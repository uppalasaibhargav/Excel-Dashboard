## AIM : Data Analsysis of call_center data using Excel Dashboard

I made these dashboard based on a database of call center data contains the call logs of customers to xyz company. This dataset contains 12 columns and 10,747 rows.

I did cleaning and arranged the column's values into it's correct datatype.

EXAMPLE : The column named  Call Duration is in general so,i changed it into number format.

I have made five charts based on the given scenario using pivot table.

Created a Line chart showing number of calls in a month(day column).

Created a pie/donut chart showing the ratio of channels.

Created a map chart of the states. 

NOTE: In case of error, copy pivot data to different cell, then create map chart. After that change the data location (chart design> select data > choose pivot table data > ok) to pivot table.


Created a Column chart for the reason of calling.

Created a Bar chart for the response time.

And i have made slicers of few columns.

At last i have placed all graphs and slicers together in a sheet and i named it as dashboard.
